## Issues With TCP
#### Terms:
- **Maximum Segement Lifetime (MSL)** - Maximum lifetime of a TCP segement, set at 120 seconds

#### Concepts:
- Recall that TCP uses a 32-bit sequence space to identify TCP segements, it is possible to wrap around this sequence space causing two TCP segements to have identical sequence numbers associated with them
- TCP assumes that each TCP segment has a maximum lifetime
  - 120 seconds
- So within this lifetime it is very possible that the 32-bit sequence space will encounter wrapping depending on the network bandwidth
  - The following table shows bandwidths that will possibly encounter sequence space wrap around

- We can address the problem above (protect against wrap around) by associating a time stamp with each TCP segment as well
- The advertised window field in the TCP header is 16-bits, but it must be big enough to allow the sender to keep the pipe full, a 16-bit advertised window allows use a maximum window size of 64 KB
  - The following illustrates that depending on the bandwidth we will need a much more than a 64 KB advertised window to keep the pipe full (assuming the receiver has unlimited buffer space)

- We can address the problem above (keep the pipe full) by including an option defining a scaling factor, this option allows TCP endpoints to agree that the advertised window counts larger chunks
- A note on options:
  - We can't solve every problem with options
  - The TCP header only has room for 44 bytes of options, we are limited

## Threads
#### Terms:
- **Thread** - A microprocess or "lightweight" process
- **Heavy Weight Process** - Traditional single threaded process

#### Concepts:
- Threads are simply a microprocess or a "lightweight" process
  - But why do we want this?
- Turns out that within most applications there are multiple tasks happening at once
  - Some of these tasks block
- If we are able to decompose these applications into multiple threads we can run tasks concurrently!
  - Gives illusion (if not on multi-cored machine) that tasks are running in parallel
- Why not just make a process per task instead?
  - Threads have the ability to share the address space amoung themselves
  - Threads are also have less overhead and therefore are cheaper to context switch than processes
- Threads share some items within a process, but also have some unique items, the following illustrates this

- As we mentioned, threads live within processes; however it should be noted that a process always has at least one thread of execution within it, though it may have more (crux of this conversation)
  - The following illustrates this idea

![alt-text](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L5-heavy-weight-vs-multithreaded.png?raw=true)

- Take note that each thread has its own registers and stack, but all threads share code, data, and files
- The reasoning that each thread needs its own stack is the following:
  - The stack contains a frame for each procedure, each frame contains local variables and the return address
  - Since each thread may be executing somewhere different in the code the stack must be unique to that thread to track where it is, the local variables it has (each thread has a different execution history)
