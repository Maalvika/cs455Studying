## Issues With TCP
#### Terms:
- **Maximum Segement Lifetime (MSL)** - Maximum lifetime of a TCP segement, set at 120 seconds

#### Concepts:
- Recall that TCP uses a 32-bit sequence space to identify TCP segements, it is possible to wrap around this sequence space causing two TCP segements to have identical sequence numbers associated with them
- TCP assumes that each TCP segment has a maximum lifetime
  - 120 seconds
- So within this lifetime it is very possible that the 32-bit sequence space will encounter wrapping depending on the network bandwidth
  - The following table shows bandwidths that will possibly encounter sequence space wrap around

- We can address the problem above (protect against wrap around) by associating a time stamp with each TCP segment as well
- The advertised window field in the TCP header is 16-bits, but it must be big enough to allow the sender to keep the pipe full, a 16-bit advertised window allows use a maximum window size of 64 KB
  - The following illustrates that depending on the bandwidth we will need a much more than a 64 KB advertised window to keep the pipe full (assuming the receiver has unlimited buffer space)

- We can address the problem above (keep the pipe full) by including an option defining a scaling factor, this option allows TCP endpoints to agree that the advertised window counts larger chunks
- A note on options:
  - We can't solve every problem with options
  - The TCP header only has room for 44 bytes of options, we are limited
