## IPv6 
#### Key Differences with IPv4:
- Source/destination addresses are 128-bits
- IPv6 treats Options as extension headers
- No fragmentation to simplify processing of packets
- No checksum
#### Packet Structure:
![IPv6 Packet header](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L4-ipv6.png?raw=true)
- **Version** - 4 bits: 0110
- **Traffic Class** - 8 bits: differentiated services for QoS, anything ending in `11` is intended for experimental/local use
- **Flow Label** - 20 bits: if non-zero, tells routers/switches to route packets on the same outbound path
- **Payload Length** - 16 bits: size of payload including extension headers
- **Next header** - 8 bits: specifies type of next header
- **Hop limit** - 8 bits: replaces time-to-live field of IPv4
- **SourceAddr/DestAddr** - 128 bits: source/destination address

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
#### Terms:
- **Port** - Abstract locator, typically implemented as a message queue. If the queue is full, message is discarded.
#### Concepts:
- Simplest possible transport protocol: extends host-to-host into process-to-process communications
- No additional functionality to best-effort service
- Adds demultiplexing

## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
#### Terms:
- **Acknowledgement (ACK)** - Confirmation of receipt of data
- **Timeout** - Retransmit if ACK not received within a specified time
- **Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)** - Use of ACKs and timeouts for reliable delivery
- **Stop-and-wait** - After transmitting one frame, sender waits for ACK before transmitting next frame
  - If the ACK doesn't arrive after a period of time, sender retransmits original frame
- **Full-duplex** - Each connection supports a pair of byte streams
- **Flow control** - Allows receiver to limit the data sender (end-to-end issue)
- **Congestion control** - Throttle how fast TCP sends data, keep sender from overloading network (hosts & networks interact)
#### Concepts:
- **Setup** - Two sides of the connection agree to exchange data, establish shared state (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
- **Teardown** - Let host know it is ok to free the shared state (FIN, ACK, FIN, ACK)
- TCP accepts data from stream, breaks it into chunks, and adds a TCP header, creating a TCP segment.
#### Header Format:

#### Sliding Window:
- Guarantees reliable delivery of data, enforces flow control between sender and receiver
- `AdvertisedWindow = MaxRcvBuffer - ((NextByteExpected-1) - LastByteRead)`
  - If the process is reading data as fast as it arrives, `AdvertisedWindow` stays open.
  - If receiving process falls behind, `AdvertisedWindow` shrinks
- TCP adheres to the receiver's advertised window
  - `EffectiveWindow = AdvertisedWindow - (LastByteSent - LastByteAcked)`
