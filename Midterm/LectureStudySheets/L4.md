## IPv6 
#### Key Differences with IPv4:
- source/destination addresses are 128-bits
- IPv6 treats Options as extension headers
- no fragmentation to simplify processing of packets
- no checksum
#### Packet Structure:
![IPv6 Packet header](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L4-ipv6.png?raw=true)
- **Version** - 4 bits: 0110
- **Traffic Class** - 8 bits: differentiated services for QoS, anything ending in `11` is intended for experimental/local use
- **Flow Label** - 20 bits: if non-zero, tells routers/switches to route packets on the same outbound path
- **Payload Length** - 16 bits: size of payload including extension headers
- **Next header** - 8 bits: specifies type of next header
- **Hop limit** - 8 bits: replaces time-to-live field of IPv4
- **SourceAddr/DestAddr** - 128 bits: source/destination address

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
#### Terms:
- **port** - abstract locator, typically implemented as a message queue. If the queue is full, message is discarded.
#### Concepts:
- simplest possible transport protocol: extends host-to-host into process-to-process communications
- no additional functionality to best-effort service
- adds demultiplexing
