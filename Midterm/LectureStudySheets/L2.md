# Lecture 2: Networking
## Networking
#### Terms:
- **Circuit Switched Network** - Network of dedicated circuits across a set of links
- **Packet Switched Network** - Network of nodes that send discrete data blocks to each other
- **Routing** - Using the address of a node to forward a message towards the destination node
#### Concepts:
![alt-text](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L2-network-connection.png?raw=true)
- As you can see a network must provide connectivity among a set of computers
- Multiple access links are limited in size
  - The geographic distance they must cross can limit size
  - The number of nodes that can be connected can limit size too (think of a node with a million wires out the back)
- Enter the switched network

- As you can see, nodes are connected indirectly through switches
  - Data is forward to the destination
- There are two types of switched networks
  - Circuit switched
  - Packet switched
- Circuit switched networks establish a dedicated circuit across a set of links
  - No one can use this dedicated circuit until its termination
  - This allows the source to send a stream of bits to the destination node
  - This was once employed by the telephone system (made popular by telephone system)
- Packet switched networks use nodes in the network to send discrete data blocks to each other
  - Utilizes a store-and-forward method
    - Node receives complete packet over some link
    - Node stores packet in internal memory
    - Node forwards complete packet to another node
  - This type of network is used by the majority of computer networks

- In order for a node to describe which node it wants to communicate with we must have a way to address every node
  - We assign a byte string to each node (uniquely distinguishes node)
  - Switches and routers can use address to forward messages torwards destination, known as routing

## Cost Effective Resource Sharing
#### Terms:
- **Multiplexing** - Sharing links at a given time among hosts
- **Synchronous Time Division Multiplexing (STDM)** - Multiplexing method that involves dividing time into qaunta and assigning each host quanta in a round-robin fashion
- **Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)** - Multiplexing method that involves transmiting data at different frequencies
- **Statistical Multiplexing** - Multiplexing method where the physical link is shared over time, data is transmitted from each flow on demand
- **Packet** - Upper bound on the size of the data block each data flow is allowed to transmit at a given time

#### Concepts:
- If want to share links at a given time amoung hosts, we must use multiplexing
  - Below is an example of multiplexing over a link

![alt-text](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L2-multiplexing.png?raw=true)

- We can multiplex using the following methods:
  - Synchronous time division multiplexing (STDM)
    - Divides time into quanta
    - Assign quanta in round-robin fashion
  - Frequency division multiplexing (FDM)
    - Transmit data flows at different frequencies
- There are a few problems with STDM and FDM:
  - They are limited to specific situations:
    - The maximum number of flows is fixed
    - Known ahead of time
  - If one of the flows has no data, its share of the link will sit idle
- These are big problems becasue in computer communications:
  - The amount of time a link is idle can be very large
  - Data flows are fluid not fixed
- An alternative multplexing approach would be statisical multiplexing
  - The physical link is shared over time
  - Data is transmitted from each flow on demand
    - Not a predetermined slot
    - Therefore say there is only one flow, there is no need to wait for quantum to come around
- There is an upper bound on the size of the data block that each flow is allowed to transmit, this is known as a packet
- Messages that are larger than a single packet are fragmented into several packets, once the receiver has all packets it will reassemble packets into original structure
- Therefore each flow sends packets over the link, decisions are made on a packet-per-packet basis
  - Below is an example of packets being multiplexed over a link by several hosts

- In some cases which packet to send over a shared link at some given time is made by switches
  - FIFO
  - Round Robin
  - Must ensure flows receive certain share of bandwidth

## Bandwidth and Latency
#### Terms:
- **Bandwidth** - Also known as throughtput, indicator of network performance that measures number of bits transmitted over the network in a given time
- **Latency** - Indicator of network performance that measures how long it takes for a message to go from one end of the network to another
- **Delay Bandwidth Product** - Product of network delay and bandwidth that describes how many bits can fit in the network pipe at a given time (bits in flight), this corresponds to how many bits the sender must send before the first the sender sent will arrive at the receiver

#### Concepts:
- Network performance is measured in two fundamental ways:
  - Bandwidth (throughput)
    - Number of bits transmitted over the network in a given time
  - Latency
    - How long it takes for a message to go from one end of the network to another
- Latency has many components:
  - Speed-of-light propagation delay (time it takes light to travel in selected medium)
  - Amount of time to transmit unit of data
  - Queueing delays
- The delay bandwidth product describes how many bits can fit in a network pipe at a given time
  - This corresponds to the number of bits that the sender must send until the first bit the sender sent is received by the receiver
  - The following is an illustration of the delay bandwidth product

- Bandwidth is improving much faster than latency because we can't make light go faster!
