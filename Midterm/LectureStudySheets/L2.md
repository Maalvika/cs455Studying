# Lecture 2: Networking
## Networking
#### Terms:
- **Circuit Switched Network** - Network of dedicated circuits across a set of links
- **Packet Switched Network** - Network of nodes that send discrete data blocks to each other
- **Routing** - Using the address of a node to forward a message towards the destination node
#### Concepts:

- As you can see a network must provide connectivity among a set of computers
- Multiple access links are limited in size
  - The geographic distance they must cross can limit size
  - The number of nodes that can be connected can limit size too (think of a node with a million wires out the back)
- Enter the switched network

- As you can see, nodes are connected indirectly through switches
  - Data is forward to the destination
- There are two types of switched networks
  - Circuit switched
  - Packet switched
- Circuit switched networks establish a dedicated circuit across a set of links
  - No one can use this dedicated circuit until its termination
  - This allows the source to send a stream of bits to the destination node
  - This was once employed by the telephone system (made popular by telephone system)
- Packet switched networks use nodes in the network to send discrete data blocks to each other
  - Utilizes a store-and-forward method
    - Node receives complete packet over some link
    - Node stores packet in internal memory
    - Node forwards complete packet to another node
  - This type of network is used by the majority of computer networks

- In order for a node to describe which node it wants to communicate with we must have a way to address every node
  - We assign a byte string to each node (uniquely distinguishes node)
  - Switches and routers can use address to forward messages torwards destination, known as routing
