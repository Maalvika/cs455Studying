# Lecture 9 : Thread Safety
## Sharing Objects
#### Terms:
- **Object Publication** - Making an object available outside of the current scope
- **Escaped Object** - An object that has been unintentionally published outside of its current scope

#### Concepts:
- Synchronization and properly sharing objects lays the foundation for writing thread-safe classes
  - A large part of syncrhonization is ensuring that we prevent one thread from modifying and object statue while another thread is using the object
- Publishing an object makes it available outside of the current scope, this can be done one of the following ways:
  - Storing a reference to it
  - Returning it from non-private method
  - Passing it as an argument to another method
- An object is said to have escaped when it was unintentionally published
- The following are dangers associated with publication:
  - Publishing internal state variables makes it difficult to perserve invariants
  - Publishing objects before they are constructed comprimises thread safety 
- The following illustrates one of the most blatant forms of publication, a public static field

- Now any Secret object that you add to KnownSecrets is published as well (it escaped!)
- The Following illustrates an internal mutable state that escapes

- What was intended to be private can now be mutated by anything that calls getStates(), oh nooo!
- The following illustrates another way to publish an internal state

- Turns out that when EventListener is published, it publishes the enclosing ThisEscape instance
- You might ask why? Well, inner class instances contain hidden references to enclosing instances!!!
- An object is a predictable consistent state only after its constructor returns
  - So publishing an object with its constructor is publishing a half baked (highly unpredictable) object!!!
  - So don't allow "this" to escape during construction
- Another common mistake is to start a thread from the constructor of an object
  - Almost anytime that a thread is started in a contstructor a reference to "this" is given to the newly started thread
  - You ask why? Remember the conversation about inner clas instances containing hidden references to the enclosing instance? Well most of the time you will be passing an inner class to the started thread, Uh oh!!
  - You can create a thread in a constructor just fine, just don't start it there. Wait for the object to be fully baked!

## Thread Confinement
#### Terms:
- **Thread Confinement** - Confining an object to a single thread, this results in thread safety even if the object is not thread safe
- **Stack Confinement** - Confining an object to the stack of a thread, no other thread may access the object becasue threads can't access the stacks of other threads

#### Concepts:
- Here are a couple important points before beginning the discussion on thread confinement:
  - Accessing shared, mutable data requires synchronization
    - Avoid this by simply not sharing
  - If data is only accessed from a single thread no synchronization is needed
  - Therefore, when an object is confined to a thread the usage is thread-safe even if the object is not
- The programming language has no means of confining an object to a thread
- Thread confinement is an element of the program's design
  - Now we are given tools to aid in this process
- The following points are on the topic of stack confinement
  - Local variables are intrinsically confined to the executing thread
    - They live on the executing thread's stack
    - Other threads can't access them
  - Therfore if we limit the access to an object through local variables we are intrinsically confining it to a single thread!
- The following illustrates the thread confinement of reference variables

- The following points are related to ThreadLocal
  - Allows you to associate a per-thread value with a value-holding object
  - Provides setter and getter methods
    - Maintains a seperate copy of each value for each thread that uses it
    - Getter returns the most recent copy of value for each thread that uses it
      - From currently executing thread
- The following illustrates the use of ThreadLocal for thread confinement

## Immutable Objects
#### Terms:
  - **Immutable Object** - An object where its state can't be modified after construction, thread-safe by due to not being modified (read only)

#### Concepts:
- An immutable object is an object where its state can't be modified after construction
  - All of the object's fields are final
  - They should be properly constructed
    - A reference to "this" should not escape the constructor
  - Read only, therefore they are thread-safe
- The following is an example of an immutable object

![alt-text](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L9-immutable-objects.png?raw=true)

- Storing a reference to an object into a public field is not enough to publish that object safely!!
  - The following illustrates this problem
  
![alt-text](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L9-safe-publication-objects.png?raw=true)

- The class is at risk of failure if not published properly

## Composing Objects
#### Terms:
**None**

#### Concepts:
- We don't want to analyze each memory access to ensure thread-safety
  - Instead we want to take thread-safe components and compose them into larger components
- The following are the basic elements of designing a thread-safe class
  - Identify variables that form the object's state
  - Identify invariants that constrain the state variables
  - Establish a synchronization policy for managing concurrent access to the object's state
- Let's go into our synchronization policy
  - It should define how object coordinates access to its state
    - While ensuring that its invariants or post-conditions are not violated
  - It specifies a combination of the following to maintain thread safety:
    - Immutability
    - Thread confinement
    - Locking
- The following illustrates a thread-safe counter

![alt-text](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L9-thread-safe-counter.png?raw=true)

- We will now discuss making a class thread-safe
  - We must ensure that invariants hold under concurrent accesss, we need to reason about state
  - Object and variables have state space
    - This is the range of possible states
    - Keep this small so that it is easier to reason about
- Let's look at a case where invariants contrain multiple state variables

![alt-text](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L9-multiple-variable-constraint.png?raw=true)
 
 - When dealing with multivariable invariants
  - Related variables must be fetched or updated in an atomic operation (all or nothing)
  - The lock that guards the variables must be held for the duration of the operation that accesses them

## State Ownership
#### Terms:
- **State Ownership** - Defininng which variables form an object's state

#### Concepts:
- We must define which variables form an object's state so that we can make good design decisions to ensure thread safety
  - Recall that a stateless object is always thread-safe
- An object encapsulates the state it owns and owns this state
  - The owner makes the decisions on the state locking protocol
  - However if you publish a reference to a mutable part of your state, you no longer make the decisions exclusivly
- An object might not be thread-safe but we can use it in a thread-safe fashion; we must ensure either that:
  - It is accessed by only one thread
  - All accesses are guarded by a lock
- The following illustrates confinement and locking working together

![alt-text](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L9-confinement-locking.png?raw=true)

## Guarding State With Private Locks
#### Terms:
**None**

#### Concepts:
- The following illustrates the concept of guarding state with a private lock

![alt-text](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L9-guarding-state-private-lock.png?raw=true)

- Why would we want to guard state with a private lock??
  - Doing this encapsulates the lock, so client code can't acquire it!
  - Publicly accessible locks allow client code to participate in its synchronization policy
    - Either correctly or not
  - If a client improperly uses an object's lock, this can cause liveness issues
