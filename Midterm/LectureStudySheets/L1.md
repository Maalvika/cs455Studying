# Lecture 1: Introduction
## Communications and Networking
#### Terms:
- **Normal Socket** - Listens on specified port number for communications, data is sent over this
  - To create a socket you need to know the Internet host you want to connect with
  - Initiates connections
- **ServerSocket** - Listens for incoming connections on a particular port on the host that runs it
  - Waits for connections
  - When a client socket attempts to establish a connection with a serverSocket:
    - The serverSocket wakes up
    - Negotiates a connection between client and server
    - Opens a normal socket between two hosts
#### Concepts:
- Since a server doesn't know when a connection will be established and by who it must block to wait for these incoming connections, this is the conecpt of a serverSocket
  - It is important to note that the serverSocket only establishes connections with clients by negotiating a normal socket, it is this normal socket that data actually travels over
## Communications and Networking: How Data Is Sent
#### Terms:
- **Signal** - Electromagnetic waves traveling at the speed of light
  - Used to send data regaurdless of medium
  - Speed of light differs per medium
- **Modulation** - How to send a pair of distinguishable signals
  - Achieve this by varying frequency, amplitude, etc.
- **Duplexity** - How many bit streams can be encoded on a link at a given time
  - **Full-Duplex** - Data can flow in both directions on a link at a given time
  - **Half-Duplex** - Data can flow in only one direction on a link at a given time
- **Non-Return to Zero (NRZ)** - Every 0 is a low signal, every 1 a high signal; when a long stream of 1's or 0's occurs the signal will not return to 0 or 1 to represent this
- **Manchester Encoding** - Every 0 is a low-to-high transition and every 1 is a high-to-low transition
  - 50 percent as efficient
- **Non-Return to Zero Inverted (NRZI)** - Make transition from current signal to encode a 1, stay at current to encode a 0
  - This solves the problem of consecutive 1's; however it does nothing for consecutive 0's
- **4B/5B Encoding** - Encoding that places extra bits in the stream (5 bits instead of 4 bits)
  - 80 percent efficient
  - Attempts to address inefficienies in Manchester encoding without suffering from extended 0's or 1's
- **Baud Rate** - rate of signal changes
  - In Manchester encoding, bit rate is 1/2 the baud rate.

#### Concepts:
- NRZ and Manchester encoding:

![NRZ and Machester Encoding](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L1-encoding.png?raw=true)
- For our purposes we will ignore the details of modulation and assume that we are only working with high and low signals
  - Map 1 to a high signal
  - Map 0 to a low signal
- NRZ suffers from **Baseline Wander**:
  - The receiver keeps the average of the signals seen so far
  - This average is used to distinguish the high signals from the low signals
  - Therefore if alot of consecutive 1's or 0's are received it can push the average too high or too low, this makes detecting certain signals difficult
- NRZ suffers from **Clock Recovery**:
  - Ever clock cycle, the sender must transmit a signal and the receiver must receive a signal
  - If the clocks of the sender and receiver are not perfectly synchronized they can't send and receive; the clocks inevitably drift from one another, so we have to constantly resynchronize
- Manchester Encoding was a solution to the baseline wander experienced in NRZ, however it is considered to be 50 percent efficient  
- 4B/5B encoding inserts extra bits into the stream to break up long sequences of 1's or 0's
  - This is done with the following encoding scheme:
  
    | 4B | 5B |
    | :-: | :-: |
    |0001|11110|
    |0010|01001|
    |0011|10100|
    |0100|10101|
    |0101|01010|
    |0110|01110|
    |0111|01111|
    |1000|10010|
    |1001|10011|
    |1010|10110|
    |1011|10111|
    |1100|11010|
    |1101|11011|
    |1110|11100|
    |1111|11101|
    
  - This works by ensuring that there exists no more than one leading 0 and no more than two trailing 0's
  - These 5-bit codes are transmitted using NRZI, this fixes all our problems!
    - Since NRZI accountes for consectuive 1's we are only concerned about consecutive 0's in the 4B/5B encoding scheme
