# Lecture 1: Introduction
## Communications and Networking
#### Terms:
- **Normal Socket** - Listens on specified port number for communications, data is sent over this
  - To create a socket you need to know the Internet host you want to connect with
  - Initiates connections
- **ServerSocket** - Listens for incoming connections on a particular port on the host that runs it
  - Waits for connections
  - When a client socket attempts to establish a connection with a serverSocket:
    - The serverSocket wakes up
    - Negotiates a connection between client and server
    - Opens a normal socket between two hosts
#### Concepts:
- Since a server doesn't know when a connection will be established and by who it must block to wait for these incoming connections, this is the conecpt of a serverSocket
  - It is important to note that the serverSocket only establishes connections with clients by negotiating a normal socket, it is this normal socket that data actually travels over
