# Lecture 1: Introduction
## Communications and Networking
#### Terms:
- **Normal Socket** - Listens on specified port number for communications, data is sent over this
  - To create a socket you need to know the Internet host you want to connect with
  - Initiates connections
- **ServerSocket** - Listens for incoming connections on a particular port on the host that runs it
  - Waits for connections
  - When a client socket attempts to establish a connection with a serverSocket:
    - The serverSocket wakes up
    - Negotiates a connection between client and server
    - Opens a normal socket between two hosts
#### Concepts:
- Since a server doesn't know when a connection will be established and by who it must block to wait for these incoming connections, this is the conecpt of a serverSocket
  - It is important to note that the serverSocket only establishes connections with clients by negotiating a normal socket, it is this normal socket that data actually travels over
## Communications and Networking {How Data Is Sent}
#### Terms:
- **Signal** - Electromagnetic waves traveling at the speed of light
  - Used to send data regaurdless of medium
  - Speed of light differs per medium
- **Modulation** - How to send a pair of distinguishable signals
  - Achieve this by varying frequency, amplitude, etc.
- **Duplexity** - How many bit streams can be encoded on a link at a given time
  - **Full-Duplex** - Data can flow in both directions on a link at a given time
  - **Half-Duplex** - Data can flow in only one direction on a link at a given time
- **Non-Return to Zero (NRZ)** - Every 0 is a low signal, every 1 a high signal; when a long stream of 1's or 0's occurs the signal will not return to 0 or 1 to represent this
- **Manchester Encoding** - Every 0 is a low-to-high transition and every 1 is a high-to-low transition
  - 50 percent as efficient

#### Concepts:
- For our purposes we will ignore the details of modulation and assume that we are onyl working with high and low signals
  - Map 1 to a high signal
  - Map 0 to a low signal
- NRZ suffers from **Baseline Wander**:
  - The receiver keeps the average of the signals seen so far
  - This average is used to distinguish the high signals from the low signals
  - Therefore if alot of consecutive 1's or 0's are received it can push the average too high or too low, this makes detecting certain signals difficult
- NRZ suffers from **Clock Recovery**:
  - Ever clock cycle, the sender must transmit a signal and the receiver must receive a signal
  - If the clocks of the sender and receiver are not perfectly synchronized they can't send and receive; the clocks inevitably drift from one another, so we have to constantly resyncrhonize
- Manchester Encoding was a solution to the baseline wander experienced in NRZ, however it is considered to be 50 percent efficient
