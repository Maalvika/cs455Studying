# Lecture 10: Thread Safety
## Vehicle Tracker Application
#### Terms:

**None**

#### Concepts:
- We will be looking at a case study involving a vehicle tracker application in this subtopic
  - We will assume the following:
    - Each vehcile is identified by a string
    - The location of a vehcile is represented by (x,y) cooordinates
    - We have a VehcileTracker class that holds this information
- We will have two threads, a viewer and updater

- Our VehicleTracker class

- Our MutablePoint class

![alt-text](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L10-mutable-point-class.png?raw=true)

- It is important to note that even though our MutablePoint class is not thread-safe, our VehicleTracker class still is
- The following illustrates a deep copy

## Adding Functionality To Existing Thread-Safe Classes
#### Terms:

**None**

#### Concepts:
- Often times we have thread-safe classes that support almost all of the operations we need, so the goal is that we want to add a new operation to the thread-safe class without undermining its thread-safety
- The safest way to add additional operations thread-safe class is the following:
  - Extend the class
  - Place the extension code in a helper class
  - Composition (combine thread-safe elements)
- The following illustrates extending Vector to have a put-if-absent method

![alt-text](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L10-put-if-absent-vector.png?raw=true)

- Sometimes extending a class or adding a method is not possible
  - An example would be if an ArrayList is wrapped with a Collections.SynchronizedList wrapper, in this case the client code does not even know the class of the List object within
  - In these situations we will use a helper class
  
- Bad example:

- Good example:

![alt-text](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L10-client-side-locking-good.png?raw=true)

- Contrasting extending a class and client side locking
  - Extending a class to add an atomic operation?
    - This distributes locking code over multiple classes in the object hierarchy
  - Client side locking is even more fragile
    - We place locking code for a Class C in classes that are completely unrelated to it
- Composition is a less fragile alternative to adding an atomic operation, the following illustrates this

![alt-text](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L10-composition.png?raw=true)

- A couple notes about ImprovedList from the example above:
  - No need to worry if the extended List class is not thread-safe, it turns out that ImprovedList uses its own intrinsic lock
  - This extra layer of syncrhonization may add a small performance penalty, but this is negilable

## Synchronized Collections
#### Terms:

**None**

#### Concepts:
- In this subtopic we will be looking at the synchronized collections in Java, this includes classes such as:
  - Vector
  - Hashtable
- There is also the synchronized wrapper classes
  - These can be created using the Collections.syncrhonized<class-name> factory methods
    - Collections.syncrhonizedList(List list)
    - Collections.syncrhonizedMap(Map map)
    - Collections.syncrhonizedSet(Set set)
- There are a few problems with syncrhonized collections
  - They are thread-safe, but required additional client-side locking to guard compound actions
    - Iteration
    - Navigation (find next element)
    - Conditional operations (put-if-absent)
- The following example illustrates the danger of using unsynchronized compound actions

- Compound actions using client-side locking, the following illustration is good

- The standard way to iterate over a Collection is with an Iterator
  - Using iterators does not mean that you need to lock the collection
  - Iterators returned by synchronized collections are not designed for concurrent modification
- Iterators of syncrhonized collections are fail-fast
- If they detect that the collection has changed since iteration began?
  - An unchecked ConcurrentModificationException is thrown
- Fail-fast iterators are not designed to be fool proof!
  - They are designed to catch concurrency errors on a good-faith basis
  - Associate a modification count with the collection
  - If the modification count changes during iteration?
    - hasNext() or next() throws ConcurrentModificationException
- The following illustrates this

![alt-text](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L10-concurrent-modification-exception.png?raw=true)

- How can we prevent a ConcurrentModificationException?
  - Hold the collection lock for the duration of the iteration
  - But what are the short comings of this?
    - Other threads that need access to the collection will block
    - If the collection is very large or the task performed on each element is intensive, the other threads could be blocked for a very long time
    - Our throughput will plummet
  - The solution to these short commings is to make a deep copy of the collection and iterate over that, the copy is thread-confined
- The following illustrates the concept of hidden iterators
