# Lecture 10: Thread Safety
## Vehicle Tracker Application
#### Terms:

#### Concepts:
- We will be looking at a case study involving a vehicle tracker application in this subtopic
  - We will assume the following:
    - Each vehcile is identified by a string
    - The location of a vehcile is represented by (x,y) cooordinates
    - We have a VehcileTracker class that holds this information
- We will have two threads, a viewer and updater

- Our MutablePoint class

- It is important to note that even though our MutablePoint class is not thread-safe, our VehicleTracker class still is
