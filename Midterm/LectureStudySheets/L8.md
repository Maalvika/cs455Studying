# Lecture 8: Thread Safety
## Thread Safety
#### Terms:
- **Wait()** - a command used to tell a thread to wait for an object lock.
- **Notify()** - a command used to tell a thread that the lock if freed.
  
#### Concepts:
- Wait-notify on its own race condition.
  - Ex. The first thread _tests the condition_
  - The second thread _sets the condition_
  - The second thread calls notify() which goes _unheard_.
  - The first thread calls wait()
- How does this race condition get solved?
  - Whenever calling wait() or notify() you must obtain the lock for the object.
- When holding a lock for an object when using wait():
  - wait() releases lock pritor to waiting.
  - It then Reacquires the lock just before returning from wait().
- Wait() is _tightly integreated_ with the lock mechanism.
  - The object lock is _not freed until_ the waiting thread is in a _state in which it can receive notifications_.
  - This prevents race conditions from occuring here.
- When a thread receives a notification it is _not_ garunteed that the condition is set.
  - _Prior_ to calling wait() you should _retest_ the condition to see if you should wait() again.
- Wait-and-notify mechanisms have no knowledge about the condition which it notifies.
  - If notify() is called when no other thread is waiting, _the notification is lost_.
- When more than one thread is waiting for a notification:
  - The language does not specify which thread will get the notification first.
    - This is based on the JVM implementation, sheculing and timing issues.
  - _There is no way to determine_ which thread will get he notification.
- NotifyAll():
  - All threads that are waiting on an object will be notified.
  - When threads are notified, they must work out which thread should continue.
  - And figure out which threads should call wait agin.
    - All threads wake up, but they _thill have to reacquire the object lock_.
- Threads and Locks:
  - _Locks are helld by threads_.
    - A thread can hold multiple locks.
  - If a lock is held by some other thread:
    - The thread _must wait_ for it to be free: _There is no preemption of locks!_.
    - If the lock is unavailable, it blocks all the waiting threads.
    
## Thread Safety

#### Concepts:
- Racing and synchronization:
  - Synchronization is used to _prevent race conditions_.
- Not all races should be be avoided:
  - _Only race-conditions withing unsafe thread-unsafe sections of the code_ are considered a problem.
    - Design code that is thread-safe without the need for synchronization.
## Concurrent Programming
#### Terms:
- **Data** - Stored in instance variables or static fields, fields from dependant objects.

#### Concepts:
- Concurrent programming requires the _correct use_ of threads and locks.
  - These are just _mechanisms_.
- An object stat includes _data_ and encompases any data that can affect its _externally visible_ behavior.
- The crux of developing thread safe programs!:
  - Managing access to _state_.
    - In particular _shared, muitable state_.
  - Shared
    - Variables could be accessed by multiple threads.
  - Mutable
    - Variable's values change over its lifetime.
  - Thread-safety
    -_Protecting data from uncontrolled concurrent access_.
- When to coordinate accesses:
  - Whenever more than one thread is accessesing a state variable, and one plans to write to it.
- How to make objects thread-safe?
  - Use _synchronization_ to _cooridinate_ access to a mutable state.
    - If you fail to do this, it will result in data corruptions and problems that manifest themselves in a myriad of forms.
- Mechanisms for synchronization in java.
  - The _synchronized_ keyword.
    - This provides exclusive locking.
  - _Volatile_ variables.
  - Explicit _locks_
  - _Atomic_ variables
- If you omit synchronizations:
  - It is a matter of _when_ not _if_ your program breaks.
  - It is easier to design a class to be thread safe _from the start_.
    - Retrofitting is extremely hard.
- Ecapsulate your state:
  - Fewer code should have access to a particular variable.
    - It is easier to rason about _conditions_ under which it might be accessed.
  - DON'T:
    - Store state in public fields.
    - Publish references to an _internal_ object.
- Fixing access to mutable state variables from multiple threads:
  - _Don't share_ state variables across threads.
  - Make state variables _immutable_
  - Use _synchronization_ to coordinate access to the state variables.
- A Thread-safe class _behaves correclty_ when accessed from multiple threads.
  - This is regardless of _scheduling or interleaving_ of execution of those threads.
  - No additional synchronization or coordination is needed from the calling code.
- Stateless objects are thread safe.

- _Transient state_ for a particular computation exists solely in _local variables_.
  - This is stored on the thread's stack and accessible only to the execting thread.
  - One thread cannot influence the result of another because they have no shared state.
- Atomicity:
  - When looking at an operation either all of an operation has executed or none of it.
  - Atomicity is in respect between operations.
- The _final_ keyword:
  - You cannot extend a final class.
  - You cannot override a final method.
  - You can only initialize a final variable _once_.
- Blank _final_ instance variable of a class:
  - This variable must be assigned _within every constructor_ of the class.
    - Trying to set it outside the constructor will result in a compilation error.
  - The value of a _final_ variable is not necessarily known at compile time.
- Compound actions like check-then-act and read-modify-write must be executed atomically for thread-safety.

## Locks & Reentrancy
#### Concepts:
- If a thread attemps to acquire a lock it already holds, it succeed.
  - Locks are acquired on a per-thread basis rather than per-invocation basis.
- For each lock:
  - Acquisition count is stored.
  - Owning thread is stored.
    - If owning thread acquires lock again, count is incremented.
    - When owning thread exits synchronized block, count is decremented.
    - If count is 0 then lock is released.
## Guarding State With Locks
#### Concepts:
- A _mutable, shared_ variable that may be accessed by multiple threads must be guarded by the _same lock_.
- For every _invariant_ that involves more than one variable:
  - _All variables_ must be guarded by the _same lock_.
- Pitfalls of over synchronization:
  - Over synchronization can lead to _poor concurrency_.
  - To fix this, control the _scope_ of the lock.
