## Encapsulation
#### Terms:
- **header** - small data structure attached to the message by lower level layers (few bytes to several dozen bytes)
- **trailer** - control info at the end of message
- **payload** - data being transmitted (also: body)
- **demux key** - info included in the header on how to demultiplex data
  - 8-bit field, can be single demux field or pair of demux fields
#### Concepts:
- Format is specific to the protocol, data is said to be encapsulated

- Low-level protocol doesn't interpret message, only compresses or encrypts data
