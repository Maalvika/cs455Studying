## Encapsulation
#### Terms:
- **header** - small data structure attached to the message by lower level layers (few bytes to several dozen bytes)
- **trailer** - control info at the end of message
- **payload** - data being transmitted (also: body)
- **demux key** - info included in the header on how to demultiplex data
  - 8-bit field, can be single demux field or pair of demux fields
#### Concepts:
- Format is specific to the protocol, data is said to be encapsulated

- Low-level protocol doesn't interpret message, only compresses or encrypts data
## OSI Network Architecture
#### Terms:
- **layers**
  - *physical layer* - handles tansmission of raw bits (bits)
  - *data link layer* - collects bits into a frame, computes checksum for frame (frames)
  - *network layer* - handles routing amoung nodes in a packet-switched network (packets)
  - *transport layer* - implements process-process channel (messages)
  - *presentation layer* - format of data exchanged between peers (format)
  - *session layer* - namespace to tie different transport-streams that are part of the application (namespace)
  
#### Concepts:
- Partitions network functionality into 7 layers
- Each layer its own header and trailer
