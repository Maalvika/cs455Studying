## Encapsulation
#### Terms:
- **Header** - small data structure attached to the message by lower level layers
  - Few bytes to several dozen bytes
- **Trailer** - control info at the end of message
- **Payload** - data being transmitted (also: body)
- **Demux Key** - information included in the header on how to demultiplex data
  - 8-bit field, can be single demux field or pair of demux fields
#### Concepts:
- Format is specific to the protocol, data is said to be encapsulated
- Low-level protocol doesn't interpret message, only compresses or encrypts data

## OSI Network Architecture
#### Terms:
- **OSI** - Open Systems Interconnections
#### Concepts:
- Partitions network functionality into 7 layers
- Each layer its own header and trailer


![OSI Headers](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L3-osi-headers.png?raw=true)
#### Layers:
- **Physical Layer** - handles tansmission of raw bits (bits)
- **Data Link Layer** - collects bits into a frame, computes checksum for frame (frames)
- **Network Layer** - handles routing amoung nodes in a packet-switched network (packets)
- **Transport Layer** - implements process-process channel (messages)
- **Presentation Layer** - format of data exchanged between peers (format)
- **Session Layer** - namespace to tie different transport-streams that are part of the application (namespace)

## Internet Architecture
#### Terms:
- **Process-per-Protocol** - each protocol in separate process
  - context-switch required at each level
- **Process-per-Message** - treat each protocol as a static piece of code
  - procedure call required at every level
#### Concepts:
- Does not imply strict layering: bypassing lowel layers is possible
- Layer has an hourglass shape: IP is the focal point

## Internetworking
#### Terms:
- **Internetwork** - arbitrary collection of interconnected hosts to provide some sort of host-host packet delivery system
  - "network of networks"
- **Internet Protocol (IP)** - key to build scalable, heterogeneous networks; runs on all nodes (hosts and routers)
  - Datagram model of delivery (connectionless, best-effort)
  - **addressing scheme** - identifies all hosts in the internetwork
  - One of its original goals is to keep routers simple
- **Datagram** - a type of packet sent in a connectionless fashion and without a need for advance setup mechanisms
- **Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)** - largest IP datagram the network can carry in its frame
  - Smaller than the largest packet-size of network (Ethernet v2: 1500 bytes, FDDI: 4500 bytes)
  - Fragmentation is necessary when a packet is larger than the MTU
#### IPv4:
- Represented as a succession of 32-bit words
- Top word transmitted first, leftmost byte transmitted first
![IPv4 Packet](https://raw.github.com/jarretflack/cs455Studying/master/Midterm/images/L3-ipv4.png?raw=true)
- **Version** - allows for redefining packet later on
- **HLen** - length of header in 32-bit words (5 words/20 bytes most of the time)
- **TOS** - terms of service (not widely implented)
  - used as - `7,6,5`: precendence bits, `4`: low delay, `3`: high throughput, `2`: high reliability, `1,0`: unused
- **Length** - length of datagram in bytes
- **Ident, Flags, Offset** - information about fragmentation
- **TTL** - time to live, used as hop count
- **Protocol** - demultiplexing key
- **Checksum** - correctness verification
- **SourceAddr/DestAddr** - source/destination address
- **Options** - presence or absence defined by size of HLen
#### Fragmentation:
- All fragments carry same identifier in Ident field
- If not all fragments arrive at receiving host, receiver gives up reassembly after timeout (~15 sec) and discards packets that did arrive
- IP does not attempt to recover from missing packets
- Fragmentation occurrs at 8-byte boundaries

## Datagram Forwarding
#### Terms:
- **Physical Network** - connected to at least one other physical network, contains at least one router
- **Internet Companion Message Protocol (ICMP)** - sends an error message back to the source when router or host is unable to process datagram 
  - Examples of possible errors:
    - Host is unreachable
    - Reassembly failed
    - TTL reached 0
    - IP checksum failed
  - Defines control messages to send back to host 
   - ex: ICMP-Redirect
